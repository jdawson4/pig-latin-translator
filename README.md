# pig-latin-translator
This repository translates .txt files of English text into .txt files of Pig Latin text.

The script titled "pigify.py" can be run in Python 3 to translate all of the files in /eng_txts to Pig Latin .txt files which will then be placed into /pig_lat_txts. This process was designed to work for English text only, but it should work for all ASCII-based text. I am unsure how it works for non-Latin-alphabet characters, so use at your own risk.

This repository includes a copy of De Bello Gallico (On the War in Gaul), as well as other Commentaries, written by Gaius Julius Caesar and translated by W. A. MacDevitt. This page also includes a copy of that text translated into Pig Latin. I figured that one can get a copy of De Bello Gallico in the original Latin, one can get a copy of De Bello Gallico in the translated English, but nobody seems to offer a copy of De Bello Gallico in Pig Latin. I downloaded the copy from Project Gutenberg's collection of free online ebooks at this URL: www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10657.

I have also included a copy of the King James translation of the Bible, as well as a King James Bible translated into Pig Latin. Again, I figure that you can access the Bible in Latin and English, but it's a shame that nobody offers the book in Pig Latin.

This script requires Python 3 to be run and can be run using the terminal command 'python pigify.py', which translates all of the (preferably) .txt files placed in /eng_txts into Pig Latin that can be placed in /pig_lat_txts. # MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FOLDER REFLECTS THE FILE STRUCTURE ON THE MAIN PAGE.
